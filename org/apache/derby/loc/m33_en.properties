X0X67.S=Columns of type ''{0}'' may not be used in CREATE INDEX, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, UNION, or DISTINCT, because comparisons are not supported for that type.
X0X85.S=Index ''{0}'' was not created because ''{1}'' is not a valid index type.
X0Y57.S=A non-nullable column cannot be added to table ''{0}'' because the table contains at least 1 row.  Non-nullable columns can only be added to empty tables.
XCL24.S=Parameter {0} appears to be an output parameter, but it has not been so designated by registerOutParameter().  If it is not an output parameter, then it has to be set to type {1}.
XCL42.S="CASCADE"
XSAJI.U=external
XBM06.D=Startup failed, an encrypted database cannot be accessed without the correct boot password.
XBCXJ.S=The application is using a version of the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) earlier than 1.2.1.  Please upgrade to JCE 1.2.1 and re-try the operation.
X0Y66.S=Cannot issue commit in a nested connection when there is a pending operation in the parent connection.
XCL15.S=A ClassCastException occurred when calling the compareTo() method on an object ''{0}''.  The parameter to compareTo() is of class ''{1}''.
XCL33.S=The table cannot be defined as a dependent of table {0} because of delete rule restrictions. (The relationship is self-referencing and a self-referencing relationship already exists with the SET NULL delete rule.) 
XIE07.S=Field & record separators can't be substring of each other.
