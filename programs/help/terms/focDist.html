<p><b>FOCAL DISTANCE</b></p>

<p>Focal distance is the distance from the earthquake focus or hypocenter to the recording site of a strong-motion record. The focus or hypocenter is the point beneath the surface of the Earth where the earthquake rupture initiated. The focal distance is calculated by using the epicentral distance and focal depth in the Pythagorean theorem.</p>
