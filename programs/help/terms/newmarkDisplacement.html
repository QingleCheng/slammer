<p><b>NEWMARK DISPLACEMENT</b></p>

<p>Newmark displacement is the amount of coseismic inertial displacement that will result from a specified slope being shaken by a given strong-motion record as estimated using a Newmark sliding-block analysis. Such displacements are always referred to as Newmark Displacements to differentiate them from actual measured field displacements. Estimated Newmark Displacements may or may not correspond closely to field displacements, depending on soil properties, pore-pressure effects, landslide type and geometry, and other factors. Rather than being thought of as a measurable field displacement, Newmark Displacement should be considered a performance index that helps us predict how a slope will perform during earthquake shaking.</p>
