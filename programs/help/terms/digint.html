<h2>DIGITIZATION INTERVAL</h2>

<p>Digitization interval is the time spacing between acceleration values in a strong-motion record. Typical digitization intervals range from 0.01 to 0.05 s. Some strong-motion records contain pairs of time and acceleration values, and the time values are not evenly spaced. Such records are called time files; they can be converted to files of acceleration values at a constant digitization interval using the Redigitize program on the &quot;Utilities&quot; page.</p>
