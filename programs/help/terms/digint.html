<p><b>DIGITIZATION INTERVAL</b></p>

<p>Digitization interval is the time spacing (in seconds) between acceleration values in a strong-motion record. Typical digitization intervals range from 0.01 to 0.005 seconds. Some strong-motion records contain pairs of time and acceleration values, and the time values are not evenly spaced. Such records are called time files; they can be converted to files of acceleration values at a constant digitization interval using the Redigitize program.</p>
