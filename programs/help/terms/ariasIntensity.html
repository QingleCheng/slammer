<h2>ARIAS INTENSITY</h2>

<p>Arias (1970) intensity is a quantitative measure of total shaking intensity that is useful in seismic hazard analysis and correlates well with the distribution of earthquake¿induced landslides. Arias intensity is the integral over time of the square of the acceleration, expressed as</p>

<p>where <i>I<sub>a</sub></i> is Arias intensity (in units of velocity, typically meters per second), <i>g</i> is the acceleration of Earth's gravity, <i>a(t)</i> is the ground acceleration as a function of time, and <i>T</i> is the total duration of strong shaking. An Arias intensity thus can be calculated for each directional component of a strong-motion record. Because Arias intensity is the integral of the entire record, it implicitly accounts for duration, amplitude and frequency content. Arias intensity is proportional to the RMS acceleration.</p>
