<p><b>PEAK GROUND ACCELERATION</b></p>

<p>Peak ground acceleration (PGA) is the most widely used measure of earthquake-shaking intensity. It is simply the maximum recorded acceleration (in either direction) in a strong-motion record. Each bi-directional component of a three-component strong-motion record will have its own PGA. Other terms generally synonymous with PGA include <i>a<sub>max</sub</i>, <i>k<sub>max</sub</i>, and <i>MHA</i>.</p>
