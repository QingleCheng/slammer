<h2>RIGID-BLOCK ANALYSIS</h2>

<p>Rigid-block analysis, first developed by Newmark (1965), treats a potential landslide block as a rigid mass (no internal deformation) that slides in a perfectly plastic manner on an inclined plane. Thus, the mass experiences no permanent displacement until the base acceleration exceeds the critical (yield) acceleration of the block; when the base acceleration exceeds the critical acceleration, the block begins to move downslope. Displacements are estimated by double-integrating the parts of an acceleration-time history that lie above the critical acceleration. Rigid-block analysis yields satisfactory results for relatively thin landslides in stiff or brittle material having period ratios (T<sub>s</sub>/T<sub>m</sub>) less than about 0.2. For thicker landslides in softer materials, rigid-block analysis tends to be conservative to overconservative.</p>
