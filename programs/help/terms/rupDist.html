<p><b>RUPTURE DISTANCE</b></p>

<p>Rupture distance is the distance from the recording site of a strong-motion record to the closest point on the fault-rupture surface. It can only be determined if a fault-rupture surface has been defined seismologically. This distance does not always relate closely to the epicentral or focal distance but is commonly closely correlated with strong shaking and damage.</p>
