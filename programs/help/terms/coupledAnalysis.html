<h2>COUPLED ANALYSIS</h2>

<p>A modification of traditional Newmark analysis in which the potential landslide block is not treated as a rigid block. The elastic dynamic response of the slide mass and the permanent displacement of the mass are modeled together so that the effect of plastic slip on the ground motions is accounted for. This type of analysis is considered the most rigorous and yields the most accurate estimates of displacement, particularly for deep landslides in soft material.</p>
