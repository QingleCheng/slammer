<h2>NEWMARK ANALYSIS</h2>

<p>Newmark (1965) proposed a method of analyzing the dynamic performance of slopes that bridges the gap between overly simplistic pseudostatic analysis and very sophisticated, but generally impractical, finite-element modeling. Although Newmark introduced his method to analyze the performance of artificial embankments, Wilson and Keefer (1983) showed that using Newmark's method to model the dynamic behavior of landslides on natural slopes yields reasonable and useful results.</p>

<p>Newmark analysis is commonly referred to as <i>rigid-block analysis</i> and is explained under the entry for that term.</p>
