<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of people have contributed to the release of this package of programs. Tom Blake deserves much credit for seeing the first release of this program (USGS OFR 01-116) and envisioning the current much more comprehensive version. His creative energy and practical perspective have been invaluable, and his relentless encouragement made this release possible. We stole his approach to laying out and conducting the simplified decoupled analysis and are grateful for his generosity in letting us use it. Ellen Rathje provided much valuable insight into various aspects of landslide deformation analysis; she also provided us with the algorithm to compute mean shaking periods of earthquake records, which enhanced this version significantly. We used strong-motion records from a variety of sources, including PEER, Cosmos, NOAA-NGDC, CGS, and a variety of other sources. We used the fast Fourier transform algorithm from Jeffrey Taft. We used the Mckoi Database, JFreeChart graphing package, and source code from the jEdit editor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I (RWJ) would like in particular to acknowledge Ray Wilson of the USGS in Menlo Park. Ray first introduced me to the details of Newmark's method while I was a young graduate student. He freely shared his algorithms (some of which still form the core of the current program package), his strong-motion files, and his time and expertise in order to show me what could be done with Newmark. Ray pioneered the use of Newmark's method in analyzing landslide potential in natural slopes, and though he has long since moved on to other studies, he deserves much credit of the current growing acceptance of Newmark's method in the hazard community. Thanks, Ray.</p>
