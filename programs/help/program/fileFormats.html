<p><b>File Formats</b></p>

<p>The program will read text files containing numeric data in any numeric format. The data can be delimited by spaces, tabs, commas, or line feeds. Any alphabetic header information must be removed from data files so that only acceleration (or time and acceleration) values are contained in the file. Programs on the <b>Utilities</b> page allow users to remove header information from files to prepare them for use in this program. For files containing time/acceleration pairs, the program assumes that the first value is a time value, the next value is the corresponding acceleration, and so on.</p>
