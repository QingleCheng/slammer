	<li><b>Simplified Empirical Models</b> contains pages that allow users to conduct (1) various types of simplified rigid-block analyses, (2) flexible (coupled) analysis, (3) flexible/rigid unified analysis, and (4) estimation of probability of failure given a specified sliding-block displacement.</li>
	<li><b>Manage/Add Records</b> contains pages allowing users to (1) view or modify record properties, (2) graph records in either time or frequency domain, or (3) add earthquake records to the database.</li>
