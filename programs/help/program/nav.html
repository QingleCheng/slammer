<ul>

	<li><b>Simplified Analyses</b> contains pages that allow users to conduct (1) various types of simplified rigid-block analyses, (2) simplified decoupled analysis, or (3) analysis of probability of failure given a specified sliding-block displacement.
	<li><b>Manage/Add Records</b> contains pages allowing users to (1) view or modify record properties, (2) graph records in either time or frequency domain, or (3) add earthquake records to the database.
	<li><b>Utilities</b> contains programs designed to convert existing strong-motion files into different forms.
