<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>This program is intended to facilitate performing Newmark sliding-block analyses. Programs available include both rigorous and simplified rigid-block analysis and a simplified decoupled analysis. Several other programs are provided to assist users in determining important properties of strong-motion records and in preparing digital strong-motion files for use in the Newmark program. This program is written in Java to facilitate use across a variety of computing platforms. Some versions of Java Runtime Environment have been included on this CD, but some users may need to acquire an appropriate version for their own platform.</p>
<p>The &quot;Definition of Terms&quot; section of the Help menu contains many useful definitions of terms used elsewhere. Users should check this section if they are uncertain about the meaning of any terms.</p>
