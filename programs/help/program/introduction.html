<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>SLAMMER is intended to facilitate performing a variety of sliding-block analyses to evaluate seismic slope performance. Programs include both rigorous and simplified rigid-block (Newmark) analysis, decoupled analysis of flexible sliding blocks, and fully coupled analysis of flexible sliding blocks. Rigorous analyses calculate displacement based on user-specified ground motions, while simplified analyses use empirical regression relationships to predict displacement based on ground-motion parameters (for example, peak ground acceleration). Several other programs are provided to assist users in determining important properties of strong-motion records and in preparing digital strong-motion files for use in the SLAMMER program. SLAMMER supersedes Jibson and Jibson (2003) and its predecessors.</p>

<p>Users should be completely familiar with the details of each sliding-block method before using SLAMMER; Jibson (2011) provided a useful overview of various types of sliding-block analysis and how to apply them. The reference list contains references to all of the methods used, and users should familiarize themselves with the details of a specific method before applying it to a particular problem.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Definition of Terms&rdquo; section of the User Guide contains many useful definitions of terms used elsewhere. Users should check this section if they are uncertain about the meaning of any terms.</p>
