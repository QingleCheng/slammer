<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This program is intended to facilitate performing various types of sliding-block analyses to evaluate seismic slope performance. Programs include both rigorous and simplified rigid-block (Newmark) analysis, decoupled analysis, and fully coupled analysis. Several other programs are provided to assist users in determining important properties of strong-motion records and in preparing digital strong-motion files for use in the SLAMMER program. This program is written in Java to facilitate use across a variety of computing platforms. Users should acquire an appropriate version of Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for their own platform; all versions of JRE can be downloaded from the following website: <a href="http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp</a>.</p>
