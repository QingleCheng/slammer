<p>This program is designed to facilitate conducting sliding-block analysis (also called permanent-deformation analysis) of slopes in order to estimate slope behavior during earthquakes. The program allows selection from among more than 2100 strong-motion records from 28 earthquakes and allows users add their own records to the collection. Any number of earthquake records can be selected using a search interface that selects records based on desired properties. Sliding-block analyses, using any combination of rigid-block (Newmark), decoupled, and fully coupled methods, are then conducted on the selected group of records, and results are compiled in both graphical and tabular form. Simplified methods for conducting each type of analysis are also included.</p>

<p>Before using this program, users should be familiar with methods of sliding block analysis, including the basic sliding-block model, the underlying model assumptions, situations where various models should and should not be applied, and the limitations and weaknesses of the models.</p>

<p>The program interface contains several tabs that sequentially move through the program sequence:</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>Getting Started</b> contains a title page with brief overview of the program and its various  pages.</li>
 <li><b>Rigorous Analyses</b> contains a series of pages to lead users through rigorous sliding-block analysis.</li>
 <li><b>Simplified Empirical Methods</b> contains pages that allow users to conduct various types of simplified sliding-block analyses.</li>
 <li><b>Manage/Add Records</b> contains pages allowing users to add earthquake records to the database, to modify their properties, and to graphically display the records in both time and frequency domains.</li>
 <li><b>Utilities</b> contains programs designed to convert existing strong-motion files into different forms.</li>
 <li><b>Help</b> contains help files for each of the program pages and detailed documentation of Newmark's method.</li>
</ul>
