<p><b>Adding Earthquake Sets From CD</b></p>

<p>If all earthquake sets were not installed on the initial installation, others may be installed by restarting the installation program. The same installation directory must be selected as on the initial installation. DO NOT REINSTALL THE PROGRAM FILES; MAKE SURE THE CHECK BOX TITLED "NEWMARK PROGRAM" IS UNCHECKED. Make sure the Newmark program is NOT running during the installation of additional earthquake sets.</p>
