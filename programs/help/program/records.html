<h2>Strong-Motion Records</h2>

<p>With only a few exceptions, the strong-motion records included in the imported program database were downloaded from the New Generation Attenuation (NGA) database, which is maintained by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER) at the University of California, Berkeley. Data about these records (station locations, source distances, earthquake locations and source mechanisms, site conditions, data sources, filtering, corrections, etc.) can be obtained from the NGA website: http://peer.berkeley.edu/nga/. Records from the 2001 Nisqually, Washington earthquake were obtained from the University of Washington.</p>

<p>File names of strong-motion records correspond to “Record” names in the program. The names consist of an alpha-numeric station code, a hyphen, and a three-digit number denoting the horizontal directional component of the record. Station names are unique. Where possible, station names used in the NGA database were retained, but in some cases these names were not unique and were therefore changed.</p>

<p>The record library contains only horizontal components because all of the sliding-block analyses use only horizontal motions.</p>
