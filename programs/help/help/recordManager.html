<h2>Manage/Add Records</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;Manage/Add Records&rdquo; page allows perusal and graphing of data on all earthquake records in the database and permits the user to add additional records for analysis. The page is divided under two tabs: Manage Records and Add Records.</p>

<p><a name="manage"><b>Manage records.</b></a> The drop-down box at the upper left allows the user to select an earthquake. When an earthquake is selected, all records for that earthquake appear in the data table in the center of the page. Saved groups from the &ldquo;Group Manager&rdquo; can also be displayed. Two types of data can be selected for display. If &ldquo;Display properties of records&rdquo; is selected, the following seismological properties of the selected records are displayed: digitization interval (s), earthquake (moment) magnitude, Arias intensity (m/s), Duration<sub>(5-95%)</sub> (s), PGA (g), PGV (cm/s), mean period (s), epicentral distance (km), focal distance (km), rupture distance (km), and focal mechanism. If &ldquo;Display properties of stations&rdquo; is selected, the following station properties are displayed: V<sub>s</sub><sup>30</sup> (shear-wave velocity of upper 30 m of material at site in m/s), Geomatrix site classification (C3), station location (descriptive), station owner, latitude, and longitude. Some data fields are blank for some records if the information was unavailable at the time of publication.</p>

<p>Station-owner codes are as follows:</p>

<p>Geomatrix site classifications (C3) are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A&mdash;Rock. V<sub>s</sub> &gt; 600 m/s or &lt; 5 m of soil over rock.</li>
	<li>B&mdash;Shallow (stiff) soil. Soil profile up to 20 m thick overlying rock.</li>
	<li>C&mdash;Deep, narrow soil. Soil profile at least 20 m thick overlying rock, in a narrow canyon or valley no more than several kilometers wide.</li>
	<li>D&mdash;Deep, broad soil. Soil profile at least 20 m thick overlying rock, in a broad valley.</li>
	<li>E&mdash;Soft, deep soil. Deep soil profile with average V<sub>s</sub> &lt; 150 m/s.</li>
</ul>

<p>Records displayed in the table can be sorted (primarily and secondarily) by any of the listed properties by making selections in the &ldquo;Sort by&rdquo; drop-down boxes. Records can be sorted in any combination of ascending or descending order using the drop-down box next to the sort boxes.</p>

<p>Records can be deleted from the database by highlighting the record(s) in the data table in the center of the page and clicking &ldquo;Delete selected record(s) from database.&rdquo; This permanently deletes the record from the program; a deleted record can only added back by using the &ldquo;Add Records&rdquo; procedure below.</p>

<p>Information on records can be added or changed using the &ldquo;Modify record&rdquo; tab at the bottom of the page. Highlighting a record in the table in the center of the page causes those record properties to appear in the boxes at the bottom of the page. Any of these properties can be modified or, if no data were entered when the records were added, new information can be input. Latitude and longitude must be in decimal degrees. The &ldquo;Focal mechanism&rdquo; and &ldquo;Site classification&rdquo; boxes have drop-down boxes permitting selection of acceptable choices. When changes have been made in the appropriate boxes, click &ldquo;Save changes&rdquo; and the information will be updated.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Graph record&rdquo; tab facilitates graphing records in a variety of ways. Begin by highlighting a record in the list. Time history, Fourier amplitude spectrum, and several response spectra can be selected for graphing. If response spectra are to be graphed, the user selects (1) whether the horizontal axis is in terms of frequency or period, (2) the response type, (3) the damping, and (4) the high-frequency cut-off. Clicking &ldquo;Graph&rdquo; will generate a separate window displaying the specified graph. Right clicking on the resulting plot box allows the user to customize the appearance of the plot, save it, print it, or zoom in or out. The graphing results can be saved as text values by clicking &ldquo;Save results as text&rdquo;; one of three delimiters can be selected.</p>

<p><a name="add"><b>Add Records.</b></a> Additional strong-motion records can be added to the database and used for analysis. Both individual records and directories containing multiple records can be added. Files must contain only acceleration values in units of g (the acceleration of Earth&rsquo;s gravity) at a constant time interval (digitization interval); no header data can be in the file. Acceleration values can be delimited in any fashion: spaces, tabs, line feeds, commas, and so forth. If files are not in this format, go to the &ldquo;Utilities&rdquo; page to convert files to the correct format.</p>

<p>Click &ldquo;Add files/directories to list&rdquo; to open a browser box to select the file or directory containing the earthquake record(s) to be added. The file or files selected will appear in the import table. The import table contains several columns; some require input, others are optional. The required columns are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><i>Import</i><i>.</i> Contains a check box to allow selection or deselection of records to be imported.</li>
	<li><i>File</i><i>.</i> Contains the path and file name of each record. This file name is the default record name (see below). This record name can be changed, if desired.</li>
	<li><i>Earthquake</i><i>.</i> Contains the earthquake name. The default earthquake name is the directory name where the files reside, but this can be changed. Earthquake names are unique and form the basis for grouping records throughout the program. To add records for an existing earthquake (including one from the permanent database), input the exact earthquake name in this column, and added records will be added to this earthquake group. To add records for a new earthquake, use a unique name, which must be used for all records for that earthquake.</li>
	<li><i>Record</i><i>.</i> Contains the record name. The default is the file name, but any name can be input.</li>
	<li><i>Digitization interval.</i> Contains the digitization interval of the records to be added. Digitization interval is the time spacing (in seconds) between acceleration values in the file<i><b>.</b></i> <i>This is a critically important parameter that must be correctly input or the programs will yield incorrect results.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Providing data in the remaining columns is optional. However, for added records to be searchable by their various properties, values for those properties must be input. Properties can be input at the time records are added or later through the &ldquo;Modify record&rdquo; procedure on the &ldquo;Manage Records&rdquo; page.</p>

<ul>
	<li><i>Magnitude</i><i>.</i> Earthquake magnitude. Magnitudes for the permanent records are moment magnitudes.</li>
	<li><i>Epicentral Distance</i><i>.</i> Distance from the recording site to the earthquake epicenter, in kilometers.</li>
	<li><i>Focal Distance</i><i>.</i> Distance from the recording site to the earthquake focus or hypocenter, in kilometers. This can be determined using the Pythagorean Theorem if the epicentral distance and focal depth are known.</li>
	<li><i>Rupture Distance</i><i>.</i> Distance from the recording site to the nearest point on the fault-rupture surface, in kilometers.</li>
	<li><i>Focal Mechanism</i><i>.</i> Choices for focal mechanism are listed in drop-down boxes that appear when a box in this column is highlighted. They include strike-slip, normal, reverse, oblique normal, and oblique reverse.</li>
	<li><i>Location</i><i>.</i> Descriptive location of recording site.</li>
	<li><i>Owner</i><i>.</i> Station owner.</li>
	<li><i>V</i><sub><i>s</i></sub><sup><i>30</i></sup><i>.</i> Shear-wave velocity (m/s) of uppermost 30 m of material at the recording site.</li>
	<li><i>Site classification</i><i>.</i> Geomatrix site classification (C3), as defined previously. Choices are listed in drop-down boxes and include letter designations A-E.</li>
	<li><i>Latitude</i><i>.</i> Latitude in decimal degrees. North latitude is positive, south latitude is negative.</li>
	<li><i>Longitude</i><i>.</i> Longitude in decimal degrees. East longitude is positive, west longitude is negative.</li>
</ul>

<p>In many cases, entire columns will contain identical data for a given group of records. To fill columns with identical data, use the &ldquo;Set all values in column&rdquo; box. Select the column from the drop-down box, and specify the value in the adjacent box. Then click &ldquo;Set&rdquo; to fill the columns with the specified value. For &ldquo;Focal mechanism&rdquo; and &ldquo;Site classification,&rdquo; a drop-down box will be available to select from among acceptable choices.</p>

<p>When records have been selected and data entered into appropriate columns, click &ldquo;Import records&rdquo; at the bottom left of the page, and the records will be added to the database. Input parameters can be proofed and modified if needed on the &ldquo;Manage Records&rdquo; page. After records have been imported, the Import check box is unchecked. If any records cannot be imported due to missing data in required fields or unreadable files, the Import check box remains checked to indicate that the record has not yet been imported.</p>

<p>When records are imported, the PGA, PGV, Arias intensity, duration, and mean period are calculated and entered into the database.</p>

<p>The file list can be cleared by clicking &ldquo;Clear list.&rdquo; Specific records can be removed from the list by highlighting the records and clicking &ldquo;Clear highlighted records from list.&rdquo;</p>
