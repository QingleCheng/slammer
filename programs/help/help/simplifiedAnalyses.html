<h2>Simplified Analyses</h2>

<p>This page allows users to select between two types of simplified analysis: rigid-block and decoupled. A third tab allows users to estimate probability of failure as a function of the displacement. Simplified analyses involve no actual integration of strong-motion records but require inputting various parameters into empirically calibrated equations that estimate slope displacement.</p>

<p><b>Rigid-Block Analysis.</b> Several types of simplified rigid-block analysis are available. Clicking on any of these analyses (1) causes a description of that analysis to appear in the bottom part of the window and (2) activates data-input boxes that specify what data are required (active boxes turn white). When the required parameters have been entered, click &quot;Compute,&quot; and the estimated Newmark displacement (in centimeters and inches) is shown under &quot;Results.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Decoupled Analysis.</b> The simplified decoupled analysis of Bray and Rathje (1998) as implemented by Blake and others (2002) is the basis for this page. A group of input parameters is specified, and various intermediate parameters are then calculated and used to estimate displacement</p>

<p><i>Input parameters:</i></p>

<ul>
	<li>Critical or yield acceleration (g), as used elsewhere.</li>
	<li>Vertical thickness, h (m), is the maximum vertical thickness between the ground surface and slip surface used to determine a<sub>c</sub>.</li>
	<li>Shear-wave velocity, V<sub>S</sub> (m/s), is the small-strain shear-wave velocity of the materials above the slip surface.</li>
	<li>Earthquake magnitude, M, is the mode magnitude based on deaggregation of seismic hazard.</li>
	<li>Peak bedrock acceleration, MHA (g), is the maximum horizontal acceleration on bedrock expected at the site, analogous to PGA or a<sub>max</sub>.</li>
	<li>Earthquake distance, r (km), is mode earthquake source distance based on deaggregation of seismic hazard.</li>
</ul>

<p>To the right of the input parameters are a group of boxes that allow specification of standard deviations (sigma) of several parameters. If these data are available they can be input; if not, zeros are in the boxes by default, which will yield mean values of the output parameters.</p>

<p>After clicking the &quot;Compute&quot; button, values for various intermediate calculations appear in the boxes under &quot;Calculations&quot;:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Site period, T<sub>s</sub> (s), is the fundamental period of the potential landslide mass, estimated as 4h/V<sub>S</sub>.</li>
	<li>Mean shaking period, T<sub>m</sub> (s), is the mean period of the input rock motion.</li>
	<li>Period ratio is T<sub>s</sub>/T<sub>m</sub>.</li>
	<li>Duration, D<sub>(5-95%)</sub> (s), is the estimated significant duration of shaking defined as the time required to build up the central 90% (from 5% to 95%) of the Arias intensity.</li>
	<li>Non-linear Response Factor, NRF, is a factor that accounts for the non-linear response of the landslide materials.</li>
	<li>Max. hor. equiv. acc. (MHEA), a<sub>max</sub> (g), is the maximum horizontal equivalent acceleration as defined by Bray and Rathje (1998) and Blake and others (2002).</li>
	<li>MHEA/(MHA&quot;NRF) is the normalized maximum horizontal acceleration.</li>
	<li>a<sub>c</sub>/a<sub>max</sub> is the critical acceleration ratio, where a<sub>c</sub> is the critical acceleration and a<sub>max</sub> is the maximum horizontal equivalent acceleration.</li>
	<li>Normalized displacement (cm/s) is as defined by Bray and Rathje (1998) and Blake and others (2002).</li>
</ul>

<p>Under &quot;Results&quot;, the estimated displacement is shown both in centimeters and inches.</p>

<p>The lower right quadrant of the page facilitates conducting a site screening procedure. If the allowable displacement is specified, then the median F<sub>eq</sub>, a factor related to the seismicity of the site (Blake and others, 2002), and the seismic coefficient for the screening procedure are displayed.</p>

<p><b>Probability of Failure.</b> The third tab opens a page that facilitates estimation of the probability of failure as a function of Newmark displacement. Enter the Newmark displacement (cm) in the input box and click &quot;Perform Analysis.&quot; The estimated probability of failure (in decimal form) is displayed. This analysis is primarily valid for fairly shallow, disrupted landslides (shallow falls and slides in rock and debris) and was calibrated using data from the 1994 Northridge earthquake; thus, it is most appropriately applied to those types of slides in southern California.</p>
