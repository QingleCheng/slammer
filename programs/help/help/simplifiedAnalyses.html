<h2>Simplified Empirical Methods</h2>

<p>This page allows users to select between three types of simplified empirical models: rigid-block, flexible (coupled), and flexible/rigid (unified). A fourth tab allows users to estimate probability of failure as a function of displacement. Simplified analyses involve no actual integration of strong-motion records but require inputting various parameters into empirically calibrated equations that estimate slope displacement.</p>

<p><a name="rigid"><b>Rigid.</b></a> Several types of simplified rigid-block analysis are available. Clicking on any of these analyses (1) causes a description of that analysis to appear in the bottom part of the window and (2) activates data-input boxes that specify what data are required (active boxes turn white). When the required parameters have been entered, click &ldquo;Compute,&rdquo; and the estimated Newmark displacement (in centimeters and inches) is shown under &ldquo;Results.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="coupled"><b>Flexible (coupled).</b></a> This tab computes displacement using the empirical model of Bray and Travasarou (2007), which is based on fully coupled, equivalent-linear sliding-block analysis of a modal system. The model requires the following input parameters:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Critical acceleration, a<sub>c</sub> (g), or yield acceleration, k<sub>y</sub>, which are equivalent.</li>
	<li>Site period, T<sub>s</sub> (s). The fundamental site period can be estimated as 4H/V<sub>s</sub> for a 1-D model or 2.6H/V<sub>s</sub> for a 2-D analysis of a triangular-shaped sliding mass, where H is the height of the landslide mass and V<sub>s</sub> is the shear-wave velocity of the landslide material.</li>
	<li>Spectral acceleration at 1.5 &times; T<sub>s</sub> (g). This can be estimated by calculating the site period (T<sub>s</sub>), multiplying by 1.5, and then estimating the spectral acceleration at that period using published attenuation equations such as Abrahamson and Silva (1997, 2008).</li>
	<li>Earthquake moment magnitude, M.</li>
</ul>

<p>This analysis calculates (1) the probability of zero displacement and (2) an estimate of the non-zero displacement. Results are shown in both centimeters and inches.</p>

<p><a name="unified"><b>Flexible/Rigid (unified model).</b></a> This model was developed by Rathje and Antonakos (2011) to provide reliable results across the full range of flexible and rigid slope conditions. The displacements are based on decoupled, equivalent-linear analysis of layered systems. The model requires the following input parameters:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Critical or yield acceleration (g), as used elsewhere.</li>
	<li>Site period, T<sub>s</sub> (s). The fundamental site period can be estimated as 4H/V<sub>s</sub> for a 1-D model or 2.6H/V<sub>s</sub> for a 2-D analysis of a triangular-shaped sliding mass, where H is the height of the landslide mass and V<sub>s</sub> is the shear-wave velocity of the landslide material.</li>
	<li>Earthquake moment magnitude, M.</li>
	<li>Peak ground acceleration, PGA (g).</li>
	<li>Peak ground velocity, PGV (cm/s).</li>
	<li>Mean shaking period, T<sub>m</sub> (s), defined by Rathje and others (2004) as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>For 5.0 &le; <i>M</i><sub><i>w</i></sub> &le; 7.25:
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ln(<i>T</i><sub><i>m</i></sub>) = -1.00 + 0.18(<i>M</i><sub><i>w</i></sub> - 6) + 0.0038<i>R</i> + 0.078<i>S</i><sub><i>C</i></sub> + 0.27<i>S</i><sub><i>D</i></sub> + 0.40(1 - <i>R</i>/20)<i>FD</i></p></li>
			<li>For <i>M</i><sub><i>w</i></sub> &gt; 7.25:
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ln(<i>T</i><sub><i>m</i></sub>) = -0.78 + 0.0038<i>R</i> + 0.078<i>S</i><sub><i>C</i></sub> + 0.27<i>S</i><sub><i>D</i></sub> + 0.40(1 - <i>R</i>/20)<i>FD</i></p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>where <i>T</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> is mean shaking period in seconds, <i>M</i><sub><i>w</i></sub> is moment magnitude, <i>R</i> is the closest distance to the fault rupture plane in kilometers, <i>S</i><sub><i>C</i></sub> and <i>S</i><sub><i>D</i></sub> are indicator variables that designate site class (<i>S</i><sub><i>C</i></sub> = <i>S</i><sub><i>D</i></sub> = 0 for site class B, <i>S</i><sub><i>C</i></sub> = 1 and <i>S</i><sub><i>D</i></sub> = 0 for site class C, <i>S</i><sub><i>C</i></sub> = 0 and <i>S</i><sub><i>D</i></sub> = 1 for site class D), and <i>FD</i> is an indicator variable that designates forward directivity conditions (<i>FD</i> = 1 for sites with <i>M</i><sub><i>w</i></sub> &ge; 6.0, <i>R</i> &le; 20 km, azimuth angle &le; 30&deg;, and rupture length ratio &ge; 0.5; <i>FD</i> = 0 otherwise or if conditions are unknown).</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>When the &ldquo;Compute&rdquo; button is clicked, several intermediate calculations are displayed under &ldquo;Calculations&rdquo;; see Rathje and Antonakos (2011) for a detailed explanation. Under &ldquo;Results&rdquo; the estimated displacement is shown in centimeters and inches.</p>

<p><a name="failure"><b>Probability of failure.</b></a> The last tab opens a page that facilitates estimation of the probability of failure as a function of Newmark displacement. Enter the Newmark displacement (cm) in the input box and click &ldquo;Compute.&rdquo; The estimated probability of failure (in decimal form) is displayed. This analysis is valid only for fairly shallow, disrupted landslides (shallow falls and slides in rock and debris) and was calibrated using data from the 1994 Northridge earthquake; thus, it is most appropriately applied to those types of slides in southern California.</p>
