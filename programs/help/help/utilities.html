<h2>Utilities</h2>

<p>This page contains six programs designed to convert existing strong-motion files into different forms. When any of the programs is selected, a brief description of what is does appears in the box at the bottom of the screen, and required input boxes become active.</p>

<p>Utility programs can be run on individual files or on all files in a specified directory. For any program selected, the path name for the source file or directory is selected using the browser window adjacent to the &ldquo;Source file or directory&rdquo; box. The file and path name for the destination file or directory are specified manually or selected with the browser window adjacent to the &ldquo;Destination file or directory&rdquo; box. If a source file contains header information that needs to be deleted, specify the number of lines in the header in the &ldquo;Delete the first ___ lines of the source file&rdquo; box. This will create a destination file that contains only acceleration values and no header information, which is the required format for adding a record to the database in &ldquo;Manage/Add Records.&rdquo; If a record contains acceleration values in the correct form (units of g) but contains header information that needs to be removed, use the &ldquo;Multiply by a constant&rdquo; option, specify a constant value of 1, and specify the number of lines in the header; a new file will be created with the header removed and the data values unchanged.</p>

<p>When all of the input boxes have the required data entered, click the &ldquo;Execute&rdquo; button to execute the program. The destination file will be written to the location specified. If a file with the name specified in the &ldquo;Destination file&rdquo; box already exists, the program prompts the user for permission to overwrite; if the &ldquo;Overwrite files without prompting&rdquo; box is checked, the program automatically overwrites the original file without a prompt.</p>

<p>The six utilities are as follows:</p>

<p><i>Convert cm/s</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> <i>to g&rsquo;s.</i> This option converts a file containing a sequence of accelerations in units of cm/s<sup>2</sup> into a file containing a sequence of accelerations in units of g. The program simply divides each value of cm/s/s by 980.665 to obtain values in terms of g.</p>

<p><i>Convert g&rsquo;s to cm/s</i><sup><i>2</i></sup>. This option converts a file containing a sequence of accelerations in units of g into a file containing a sequence of accelerations in units of cm/s<sup>2</sup>. The program simply multiplies each value by 980.665 to obtain values in cm/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p><i>Multiply by a Constant</i>. This option multiplies the values in a file by a user-specified constant. The constant is specified in the &ldquo;Constant&rdquo; field. This program is useful for files that contain values in units other than g&rsquo;s or cm/s/s that need to be converted to g&rsquo;s for use in SLAMMER.</p>

<p><i>Redigitize.</i> This option converts a time file (a file containing paired time and acceleration values) into a file containing a sequence of acceleration values having a constant time spacing (digitization interval) using an interpolation algorithm. The program assumes that the first value in the file is a time value, followed by a corresponding acceleration value, and so on. The digitization interval for the output file must be specified in the &ldquo;Digitization interval&rdquo; field; any value can be selected by the user, but values of 0.01-0.05 generally are appropriate. The output (destination) file is in the format necessary to run the other programs in this package, but if the original time file had units other than g, it will be necessary to convert to g before adding the file to the database in &ldquo;Manage/Add Records.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Bracket records</i>. This option allows users to delete parts of a file that occur before and after a specified value. This is useful in reducing file sizes by eliminating &ldquo;dead time&rdquo; in a record. This utility allows the user to retain some points before and after the bracket value for lead-in and lead-out time.</p>

<p><i>Trim records</i>. This option allows users to delete parts of records before and after specific times in the record. In addition to the cut-off times, the digitization interval must be specified.</p>
