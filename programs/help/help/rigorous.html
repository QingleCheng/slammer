<h2>Rigorous Analyses</h2>

<p>This page contains four tabs. The first three tabs, numbered as sequential steps, take users through a rigorous sliding-block analysis: (1) Select Records, (2) Select Analyses, and (3) Perform Analyses and View Results. The fourth tab provides guidance about which type of analysis is appropriate for a specified set of conditions. Each of these tabs is explained below:</p>

<h3><a name="step1">Step 1: Select Records</a></h3>

<p>This page allows users to select which earthquake strong-motion records will be used in an analysis. Records can be selected in one of two ways, indicated by the two tabs on this page: (1) Search records by properties, or (2) Select individual records.</p>

<p><i>Search Records by Properties.</i> To search for records based on record properties, simply enter values into any of the search fields desired. Any number of search fields can be used concurrently in any search. For a given property, one or both of the fields can be used: to search a range of values, use both fields; to search for all records above or below a certain value, use only a single field. To search for a unique value, put the same value in both fields. See the &quot;Definition of terms&quot; section of the Help menu for definitions of the various properties listed, including the various definitions of distance. If users add records to the database and do not include some of these properties, those records will not be selected on a search of a property for which no data have been provided. When the desired search parameters have been specified, click the &quot;Search for records&quot; button. A message to the right of the search fields will indicate when the search is completed and how many records matched the criteria. The records meeting the search criteria will appear in the &quot;Records selected&quot; list at the bottom of the page. This list also displays all of the properties of each record. Multiple searches can be conducted, and all new records identified in a given search will be added to the list. No duplicate records are allowed on the list; thus, if a search identifies a record that is already on the list, it is ignored. To clear the search fields between searches, click the &quot;Clear all search fields&quot; button.</p>

<p><i>Select individual records.</i> To search for records individually by name, click on the down arrow under the &quot;Earthquake&quot; heading. Select an earthquake from the list of earthquakes displayed. Then click the down arrow under &quot;Record name&quot; and select the desired record from the list. Then click &quot;Select record&quot; to add that record to the &quot;Records selected&quot; list. For each earthquake, &quot;Select all records&quot; is displayed at the top of the Record list; use this option to select all records from a given earthquake.</p>

<p>The &quot;Records selected&quot; list at the bottom of the page displays all of the properties of the earthquake records selected (units are the same as indicated in the search boxes at the top of the page). The table display can be toggled between displaying properties of specific records (e.g., Arias intensity, duration, PGA, source distance, etc.) and properties of the station in general (e.g., location, latitude and longitude, site classification, etc.). Records in the table can be sorted by any of the properties listed by selecting those properties in the primary and secondary &quot;Sort by&quot; boxes at the top of the table. Records can be sorted in any combination of ascending (A) or descending (D) order using the drop-down box next to the sort boxes.</p>

<p>The last column on the right contains a check box that allows the user to indicate whether or not each record is to be included in the analysis. When records are added to the table, they are selected by default. All the records on the list can be selected or deselected by clicking on the buttons at the upper right corner of the list. Individual records can be selected or deselected by clicking the individual check box corresponding to that record. The &quot;Clear table&quot; button at the bottom deletes all records from the table; the &quot;Delete highlighted record(s)&quot; button deletes all highlighted records.</p>

<p>&quot;Manage Groups&quot;&quot; (bottom left) is used to save groups of records for future use. The Group Manager allows users to retrieve previously saved groups, to name and add new groups, and to delete groups. Groups of records with their associated properties can also be exported in a variety of formats; this allows users to import the information displayed in the table into a spreadsheet or other program if other types of analysis on record properties is desired.</p>

<p>When all the desired records have been added to the table and selected, click on the &quot;Go to Step 2: Select Analyses&quot; button at the bottom right or the &quot;Go to Step 2: Select Analyses&quot; tab on the top of the page to go to the next page.</p>

<h3><a name="step2">Step 2: Select Analyses</a></h3>

<p>This page requires the user to specify basic analysis properties and the types of analyses to be performed.</p>

<p><i>Choose Analysis Properties.</i> The following analysis properties must be specified:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Units: Choose metric or English units for input parameters and analysis results. If properties on the bottom of the page have been input in one set of units, switching to a different set of units will cause the values in the input boxes to automatically convert to the specified set of units.</li>
	<li>Scaling: Selected records can be analyzed (1) unscaled, (2) scaled to a uniform PGA (specified in terms of g), or (3) scaled by a specified constant.</li>
	<li>Critical Acceleration: Critical (yield) acceleration is the threshold ground acceleration required to initiate landslide movement and is specified in terms of g, the acceleration of Earth&quot;s gravity. Two choices are available for specifying critical acceleration. If &quot;Constant&quot; is selected, a single value is entered into the corresponding field; in this situation, the landslide critical acceleration remains constant throughout the analysis. If &quot;Varies with displacement&quot; is selected, the user can enter pairs of displacement/critical acceleration values to define a curve of varying critical acceleration as a function of displacement. Each successive value of displacement must be greater than the previous value. A value of &quot;0&quot; is locked into the upper left box, which indicates that the analysis begins at zero displacement. When the initial value of critical acceleration is added to the right-hand box in the first row, the &quot;Enter&quot; key must be used to save the value. Any number of points (paired values) can be input by clicking on the &quot;Add row&quot; button. Any empty rows must be deleted for the analysis to run. The program linearly interpolates critical-acceleration values between points. The critical acceleration remains constant at the last value specified when the last displacement specified is exceeded.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Choose Types of Analysis:</i></p>

<p>Any or all types of analysis can be performed simultaneously. Check the boxes next to the types of analysis desired.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rigid Block: This type of analysis can be conducted so as to allow only downslope displacement or to allow both upslope and downslope displacement. If the latter is selected, the thrust angle of the potential landslide block must be specified.</li>
	<li>Coupled and Decoupled: Conducting coupled and (or) decoupled analysis requires specifying several slope properties: (1) Height, the vertical thickness of the potential landslide block, (2) the shear-wave velocity of the material above the slip surface, (3) the shear-wave velocity of the material below the slip surface, and (4) the damping ratio. The type of soil model, linear elastic or equivalent linear, must also be specified.</li>
</ul>

<p>When all parameters have been entered on this page, click on &quot;Go to Step 3: Perform Analyses and View Results&quot; at the lower right, or click the &quot;Go to Step 3: Perform Analyses and View Results&quot; tab on the top of the page.</p>

<h3><a name="step3">Step 3: Perform Analyses and View Results</a></h3>

<p>Results can be displayed to any number of decimals specified in the input box at the upper left. When the &quot;Perform Analysis&quot; button is clicked, the selected records will be analyzed, and the results will be displayed in the table. Processing time depends on the number and size of the records selected and the types of analyses being performed. An indicator bar shows the progress as each record is analyzed.</p>

<p>The results table shows the earthquake name, the record name, and calculated displacements for the types of analysis selected. Three displacements are shown for each type of analysis and for each record analyzed: (1) normal polarity (the &quot;top&quot; or positive accelerations), (2) inverse polarity (the &quot;bottom&quot; or negative accelerations), and (3) the average of the two polarities. All displacements are given in centimeters if metric units were specified or in inches if English units were specified. At the bottom of the table, the mean, median, and standard deviation (based on population) of the average displacements are shown.</p>

<p>Click on &quot;Clear output&quot; in the upper right part of the page to clear the currently displayed results and any corresponding plots.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the page, three tabs allow graphing or saving the data from the Results table:</p>

<p><i>Graph Displacements.</i> Plots showing time histories of displacements can be generated. Select the analyses whose results are to be graphed and the desired polarity (average values cannot be graphed) and click &quot;Plot displacements versus time.&quot; Results from any combination of analyses can be plotted together. Right clicking on the resulting plot box allows the user to customize the appearance of the plot, save it, print it, or zoom in or out. Checking the &quot;Display legend&quot; box will display a legend keying colors of curves to specific earthquake records. There are a limited number of colors available for plotting, so plots having large numbers of records will have duplicate colors for some records. Plotting displacements for large numbers of records makes plotting labels infeasible and can take several seconds; during this time the plot window will display a plain gray background until the plot appears.</p>

<p><i>Graph Histogram.</i> Histograms of the results of each type of analysis can be plotted. Results from only one type of analysis can be plotted on a single histogram. Average, normal, or inverse polarities can be plotted. Any number of histogram bins can be specified; the default is 10. Right clicking on the resulting plot box allows the user to customize the appearance of the plot, save it, print it, or zoom in or out.</p>

<p><i>Save Results Table.</i> Data in the Results table can be saved in a tab-, space-, or comma-delimited file by specifying the file type and clicking on &quot;Save Results Table.&quot; Thus, users can export these data to other programs for more detailed statistical analysis.</p>

<h3><a name="which">Which Analysis Should I Use?</a></h3>

<p>Different analyses (rigid-block, decoupled, coupled) yield different displacements depending on the slope conditions being modeled. While no single &quot;right&quot; displacement exists, research comparing different types of analysis has indicated which types of analysis are best suited for various slope conditions. The method used to determine the best type of analysis is based on the period ratio (T<sub>s</sub>/T<sub>m</sub>), which is the ratio of the site period (T<sub>s</sub>) to the mean period of the earthquake shaking (T<sub>m</sub>). These values can be estimated using the input parameters specified on this page: the vertical thickness of the landslide block, the shear-wave velocity of the landslide material, the earthquake (moment) magnitude, the earthquake source distance, and, if known, the mean period of the earthquake shaking (if not known, this is estimated using the other input parameters).</p>

<p>Clicking &quot;Compute&quot; causes the period ratio to be computed and yields comments on the appropriateness of each type of analysis.</p>
