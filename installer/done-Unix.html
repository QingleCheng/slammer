Newmark has been installed successfully.<p>

To start Newmark, make sure the "shortcut directory" is listed in
your "PATH", and run the <tt>newmark</tt> shell script from the command
line. For example:

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><b>$</b> newmark</td></tr></table>

You may also want to add this command to your programs menu, create a
launcher icon, or do whatever else to make Newmark accessable from your desktop
environment.
